                <h1>Four score and seven years ago I had a dream the Starship Enterprise, on her 7 year mission, to explore the reaches of space.</h1>
                <p>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Tryhard nation attacked.</p>
                <p>Only the randomderps master of all four counterstrikes, could stop them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</p>
                <p>A hundred years passed and Ccorn and I (randomrandomguy) discovered the new randomderp, a randomderp named 1480c.</p>
                <p>And although his derping skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he is ready to randomderp.</p>
                <h4>But we believe 1480c can defeat the Tryhards.</h4>
